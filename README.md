# MakeSoft-SOEN341_Project_F24

# Project Overview
The Peer Assessment System is designed for university team projects, allowing students to evaluate their teammates based on, cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. The system is meant to promote accountability and provide feedback to both students and instructors about individual contributions. Instructors can manage teams, monitor performance, and export results for grading purposes.

The project is developed using Agile Scrum methodology over 4 sprints, using GitHub for version control, task management, and collaboration. Our goal is to deliver a prototype that demonstrates core functionality.

# How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the Makesoft application, which includes both the backend (Java/Spring Boot) and the frontend (React).

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**
- **Node.js and npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **An IDE for Java** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA)
- **An IDE or text editor for JavaScript** (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)


## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Anthony4044/MakeSoft-SOEN341_Project_F24.git
```


### 2. Set Up the Backend (Java/Spring Boot)

#### a. Install PostgreSQL

- **Download PostgreSQL:**
  - Visit the [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) page.
  - Download the installer for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.

#### b. Launch pgAdmin 4

- **Open pgAdmin 4:**
  - After installing PostgreSQL, launch pgAdmin 4 from your applications menu.
  - You might be prompted to set a master password if it's your first time using pgAdmin.

#### c. Create a New Database


-  **Create Database:**
   - Expand **Servers** > **Local PostgreSQL** > **Databases**.
   - Right-click on **Databases** and select **Create** > **Database...**.
   - **General Tab:**
     - **Database:** `PeerReview`
   - Click **Save**.

#### d. Navigate to the Backend Directory

```
cd Makesoft
```

#### e. Open the Project in Your Java IDE

- Open **IntelliJ IDEA** or your preferred Java IDE.
- Choose **Open** or **Import Project**, then select the `Makesoft` folder you just cloned.

#### f. Run the Backend Application

- Locate the `MakesoftApplication.java` file in the `src/main/java` directory.
- Right-click on `MakesoftApplication.java` and select **Run**.
- The Spring Boot application should start, and you should see logs indicating that the back end is running.

### 3. Set Up the Frontend (React)

#### a. Navigate to the Frontend Directory

In a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory:

```
cd MakeSoftReact
```

#### b. Install Node.js Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. You can check by running:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

If not installed, download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

#### c. Install Required Packages

Run the following commands to install the necessary npm packages:

```
npm install 
```

#### d. Start the Frontend Application

```
npm start
```

This should open a new browser window or tab pointing to `http://localhost:3000`. If it doesn't open automatically, you can manually navigate to this URL.

### 4. Interact with the Application

- With both the backend and frontend running, you can now interact with the website.
- The frontend communicates with the backend API running on `http://localhost:8080`.



# User Stories
The project is organized into user stories, each user story is broken down into smaller tasks.

## Example User Stories (Prefix: US.#):
- **US.01: Student Login System**
  - As a student, I want to log in to the system using my university credentials, so that I can access my assigned team information.
  
- **US.02: Instructor Creates Teams**
  - As an instructor, I want to create teams and assign students by importing a CSV file, so that I can manage student groups efficiently.

Visit the [Sprint Plan](./docs/sprint_plan.Xlsx) to see a comprehensive list of user stories and tasks, along with additional information. 

# Task Breakdown
Each user story has been broken down into tasks. Tasks are assigned to team members, and tracked via GitHub Issues and the project board.

## Example Tasks (Prefix: Task.#):
- **Task.01.01**: Create login page (Frontend).
- **Task.02.01**: CSV file import functionality for instructors.

Visit the [Sprint Plan](./docs/sprint_plan.xlsx) to see a comprehensive list of user stories and tasks, along with additional information.

# Coding Standards for Spring Boot and React Project

## General Standards
1. **Code Readability**:
   - Use clear and meaningful variable, class, and method names.
   - Add comments for complex logic and configurations.
   - Avoid long methods; keep functions concise and focused.

2. **Version Control**:
   - Use feature branches for development (`feature/<feature-name>`).
   - Commit often with descriptive messages.
   - Merge changes only after code reviews.


---

## Back-End Standards (Spring Boot)

### 1. Project Structure
- Follow a layered architecture (e.g., `controller`, `service`, `repository`, `model`).

### 2. Coding Practices
- Use `@RestController` for RESTful APIs.
- Apply `@Transactional` for methods that modify the database.
- Validate inputs using `@Valid` and `@NotNull`.

### 3. Error Handling
- Return meaningful HTTP status codes (e.g., `400` for bad requests, `404` for not found).

### 4. Database Interactions
- Use JPA repositories for CRUD operations.

### 5. Testing
- Write unit tests using JUnit and Mockito.

---

## Front-End Standards (React)

### 1. Project Structure
- Separate logic into reusable hooks where appropriate.

### 2. Coding Practices
- Use functional components with React hooks.
- Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `camelCase` for variables, `PascalCase` for components).


### 3. Styling
- Use CSS modules or styled-components for scoped styling.
- Maintain a theme file for global styles (e.g., colors, fonts).


### 5. Testing
- Write unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Ensure coverage for key user interactions and components.

---

## Code Review Process
1. Submit a pull request for every feature or bug fix.
2. At least one team member must review and approve the changes.
3. Use a checklist for PRs:
   - Code adheres to standards.
   - No hardcoded values or secrets.
   - Tests are included for new features.
