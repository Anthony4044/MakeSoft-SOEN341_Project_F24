# MakeSoft-SOEN341_Project_F24

## Project Overview
The Peer Assessment System is designed for university team projects, allowing students to evaluate their teammates based on, cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. The system is meant to promote accountability and provide feedback to both students and instructors about individual contributions. Instructors can manage teams, monitor performance, and export results for grading purposes.

The project is developed using Agile Scrum methodology over 4 sprints, using GitHub for version control, task management, and collaboration. Our goal is to deliver a prototype that demonstrates core functionality.

## Sprint Plan
We are following a 10-week project schedule with 4 sprints.

### Sprint 1 - User Authentication & Team Management
- **Goals**: 
  - Implement user authentication for students and instructors.
  - Allow instructors to create teams and assign students.
  - Ensure that teams are visible to both students and instructors.
- **Key Features**:
  - Student/Instructor login with role-based access.
  - Team creation and CSV file import functionality for instructors.
  - Visibility of teams for all users.

## User Stories
The project is organized into user stories, each user story is broken down into smaller tasks.

### Example User Stories (Prefix: US.#):
- **US.01: Student Login System**
  - As a student, I want to log in to the system using my university credentials, so that I can access my assigned team information.
  
- **US.02: Instructor Creates Teams**
  - As an instructor, I want to create teams and assign students by importing a CSV file, so that I can manage student groups efficiently.

Visit the [Sprint Plan](./docs/sprint_plan.md) to see a comprehensive list of user stories and tasks, along with additional information. 

## Task Breakdown
Each user story has been broken down into tasks. Tasks are assigned to team members, and tracked via GitHub Issues and the project board.

### Example Tasks (Prefix: Task.#):
- **Task.01.01**: Set up authentication service.
- **Task.01.02**: Create login page (Frontend).
- **Task.02.01**: CSV file import functionality for instructors.
