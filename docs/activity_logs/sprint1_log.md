**Worked On:**

- Implemented student sign up logic for backend

- made a .gitignore file in order to fix an issue that prevented team members from pushing due to project files exceeding 100MB 
- caused by the node_modules folder


**Comments/Notes:**
- Getting the .gitignore file to work took around 4 hours due to the fact that the
- node_modules folder was already pushed before and the .gitignore did not work as expected
